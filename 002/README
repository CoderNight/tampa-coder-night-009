Goal:
It's been 10 years since I looked at language grammars. I've always wanted to use them more in my work, but never
have the time to figure them out again. peg.js (http://pegjs.majda.cz/) is used to generate a parser from the grammar
in lib/logo_language.pegjs.

Requires:
node.js (tested on v0.10.15)

Usage:
(Re)generate the parser from the grammar:
node lib/pegjs lib/logo_language.pegjs

will generate lib/logo_language.js

Run:
node bin/logoapp.js file.logo
